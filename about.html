<h2>About Me</h2>

<article>
<p>My name is Annie Bae and I am a recent graduate from Rutgers University.</p>
<p>After months of searching and applying to jobs in the e-commerce field, I came across many openings for programming and software engineering positions. I spoke with my cousin, who attended General Assembly's three-month immersive program. He said it was one of the best decisions he has made yet. Its hands-on learning and interactive class has taught him to really apply himself proactively and being able to build something from scratch is just an exhilarating and exciting feeling.</p>
<p>I was always interested in making websites and have created my own webpages throughout the years. Not too long ago, I created my own blog to log my travels from studying abroad. It started as a private journal to keep for myself, but soon went public as friends and family grew curious of how I was doing. It got a lot of media attention so I decided to go more in depth and really cater my page so that readers could have a good experience while visiting my blog. This has inspired me to learn more about programming and coding in general. As the tech generation booms, I'd like to learn more and be ready for the next steps.</p>
<h2>Hobbies</h2>
As much as I hate to admit this, I am a huge sucker for social media; however, when I'm not scrolling away on those sites, I can be found exploring any quaint neighborhood. I love discovering new quirky places like hole-in-the-wall coffee shops and tastefully artsy murals. My three biggest hobbies are photography, tennis, and running. Traveling has also been a big favorite of mine, though I wish I had more time to set aside for that. Feel free to sneak a peek at my Instagram (in Contacts) to see some photos I have taken along the way!
